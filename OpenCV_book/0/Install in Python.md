```
pip install opencv-python​
```
Install OpenCV in python is easy and just need few steps. 
Based on Python 3.11 you can install OpenCV 5 with below commands.
```python
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
Pip install pirahansiah
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```
The `pip install opencv-python` will be install OpenCV 5 and in most cases it all you need. However, if you want to use other advanced method which may not license free you can install extra package of OpenCV by using `pip install opencv-contrib-python` command. For demo purposes I created a package for simplify running demo function without entering a lot of codes `Pip install pirahansiah`. if you use conda and you want to use ffmpeg (a package for multimedia) you can use `conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg` command. 

## OpenCV import
For the OpenCV you need to import `cv2`
`import cv2`
And you may need two other packages 
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
`import numpy as np`
